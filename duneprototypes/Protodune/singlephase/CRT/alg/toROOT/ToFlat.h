//Brief: Converts Triggers to a flat TTree.  Useful when Sarah wants to access CRT output 
//       in python.  
//Usage: Provide one or more EBuilder output files on
// the command line.  Files should have been produced by EBuilder.
//
//       fromEBuilder/toROOTFlat <one EBuilder file name> [another EBuilder file name]...
